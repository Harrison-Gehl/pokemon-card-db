# pokemon-card-db
This (will be) a lightweight Android app that will allow users to keep track of their Pokemon card collection.
I intend for this to be a self-contained application where the data will be stored on the local device (i do not want to host a server).

This project is not affiliated with Nintendo, Pokemon TCG, or the affiliated copyright owners

i.e. ((please do not sue me, i just wanna track my pokemon cards))
